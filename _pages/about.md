I am a CS PhD student at Yale University supervised by [Prof. Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/). <br><br>
I completed my B.Eng Computer Science degree in [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/) where I worked with Prof. [Shafiq Rayhan Joty](https://raihanjoty.github.io/) on text summarization and text generation. At NTU, I was awarded the Best Final Year Thesis Gold Medal.
